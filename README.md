Programming Fonts
================

Test drive programming fonts [online in your browser](https://www.programmingfonts.org/). The interactive counter part of the [Tumblr Blog](https://programmingfonts.tumblr.com).

ProgrammingFonts.org makes it easier to find monospaced fonts. All fonts in one place, with proper credits towards the creators. It's not a download portal, we don't track anything, it's strictly by nerds and designers for nerds and designers.

This website is powered by coffee. No ads, no tracking, no monetization. We do have some costs for domain name. And coffee. Gallons of coffee.
Please feel free to make a little [donation via PayPal](https://paypal.me/koenlageveen) to keep this labour of love running. It's much appreciated!

## Project layout / contributing

- All information about the fonts is stored in [fonts.json](https://github.com/braver/programmingfonts/blob/gh-pages/fonts.json).
  - Which adheres to [a schema](https://github.com/braver/programmingfonts/blob/gh-pages/fonts-schema.json).
- Font files are stored in [fonts/resources](https://github.com/braver/programmingfonts/tree/gh-pages/fonts/resources).
  - We store only 4 variants (if available), in `.woff2` format (if available): regular, italic, bold, bold+italic
- All font files (and directories) are normalized to lowercase, without `-mono` unless it's really part of the name.
- The [fonts.less](https://github.com/braver/programmingfonts/blob/gh-pages/fonts/stylesheets/fonts.less) registers the variants for each font "alias" and is used to generate the stylesheets.
- The license needs to allow serving in a website, or an agreement with the font creators needs to be made. If available we add the license along with the font files.
- Running `npm install && npm run test` checks the json and builds the stylesheet. 

## Todo's

There are some limitations to the current approach. For instance, we only load the default set for each font. So, mostly:

- It' currently not possible to explore different weights (e.g. Source Code Pro Light). 
- Open type alternatives for zero style, and other options (e.g. all the different variations possible with [Input Mono](https://input.fontbureau.com)) are not exposed.
- I would be nice to include more commercial fonts. Creators need to eat too, and not all the best fonts are open source. However, it is not always possible to arrange a license for usage of the font in this website.
- Character set coverage and other valuable information, e.g. if a font has true italics, is not exposed.
- Background info on each font can usually be found in the blog (ongoing project: adding this to the `description` property for each font).
